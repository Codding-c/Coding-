write a c program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200(both include), the number obtained should be printed in a  coma separated sequence on a single line.
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
 for(int i=2000;i<=3200;i++){
     if(i%7==0 && i%5!=0){
         printf("%d,",i);
     }
 }
 return 0;
}
